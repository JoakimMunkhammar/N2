This function generates minute resolution global, beam and diffuse clear-sky indices from hour resolution global clear-sky index. This is based on the Markov-chain mixture distribition model for multiple time-series generation at Github: github.com/JoakimMunkhammar/MultiComponentMarkov

The specific downscaling method was published in proceedings of (Solar Integration Workshop 2022)
